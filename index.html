					<h2>Starting Out</h2>
					<p>When I was I started attending local independent wrestling shows. I wanted to be involved in the business
					   so I started talking to wrestlers at the shows. I made a few that would help me start training to be a pro wrestler.
					   After training for a month I realized I didn't want to be a wrestler but I still wanted to be part of the business.</p>
					<h2 id="roh">Ring Crew of Honor</h2>

					<p>After deciding to no longer train to be a wrestler, I stayed being in the ring crew. There are 3 big wrestling companies
					in America. &copy;Ring of Honor was my favorite. Every couple of months they would run a show in Chicago. One day I got to the
					Chicago venue early to see if I could help set up. They let me set up for them and after a few shows they started showing
					me how to set up and work the lights for the stage. I was able to work for (at the time) 3rd largest company in America.
					I was pretty happy.</p>
					<h2 class="impact">IMPACT! Wrestling Ring Crew</h2>

					<p>One day the 2nd largest company was running a show in St. Louis. Through  the contacts I had made at Ring of Honor, 
					I was able to go work for them for the day. I was able to eat with Hulk Hogan, Sting, and some other big stars (even though
					they were at a different table we still had lunch and dinner at the same time in the same room, tables apart). That was one of the coolest
					experiences from a wrestling stand point.</p>
